## About
This project was inspired by daily newsletters like "Morning Brew" and "Daily Upside." Rather than constantly writing a newsletter that needs to be updated daily to a list of subscribers/readers, I thought it'd be cool to have a series of emails "encapsulated in time, where subscribers will get a series of emails in order from the time of subscription. So if a writer writes a series of 10 emails, subscribers will receive an email per day for 10 days - no matter if they subscribe today or 10 years from now.

This is my first flask project. I followed this great video from "Traversy Media" to build the framework for the site and added my own functionality and changes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w25ea_I89iM&list=LL&index=8).

I'm working on deploying this to heroku, and so it will be a live website!
